5/17/2012

Build Setup instructions
========================

1) Acquire PHP Source Code for your target platform
2) Place this folder in the ext folder with the other extensions
3) run "phpize" (should be installed along with PHP on the machine)
4) run "./configure" (see other tutorials for enabling debugging and all that nonsense.
5) If all went well you can run "make" which will build and put the "groundctrl.so" file in the "modules" folder.

To rebuild the module after changing code run "make clean" then "make".
